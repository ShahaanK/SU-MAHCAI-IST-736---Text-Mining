# Chapter 1 — Introduction to Data Science (IST 687)

This folder contains my completed work for **Chapter 1** of *Data Science for Business with R* by Jeffrey S. Saltz and Jeffrey M. Stanton.  
All work is part of my progress in **IST 687: Introduction to Data Science**, taught by **Christopher Dunham**, during my Master's of Science in **Applied Human-Centered AI** at Syracuse University:contentReference.

## Contents
- **Case Study: Calculating Net Promoter Score (NPS)**  
  - Implemented in R using vectors and conditional logic.  
  - Final NPS result: **18.18%**, with responses ranging between 3–9:contentReference.

- **Chapter End Questions** (vector manipulation practice in R):  
  1. Add a family member’s age with `c()` and `append()`.  
  2. Use square bracket subsetting to show the first element.  
  3. Show odd-numbered items with subsetting and `seq()`.  
  4. Conditional expression returning TRUE for values equal to 12.  
  5. Negated conditional expression (using `!=`).  
  6. Subsetting values not equal to 12.  
  7. Power user: Using the built-in `Nile` dataset to count years where water level > 900 (result: **49 times**).
