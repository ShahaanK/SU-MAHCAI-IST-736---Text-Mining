After taking this course, the students will be expected to understand:
- Describe basic concepts and methods in text mining, for example text
representation, text classification and clustering, and topic modeling;
- Use the text mining concepts and methods to model real-world problems into text
mining tasks, develop technical solutions, and evaluate the effectiveness of the
solutions.
- Communicate text mining process, result, and major findings to various audience
including both experts and laypersons.
